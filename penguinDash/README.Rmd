The goal of `penguinDash` is to provide an interactive Shiny dashboard for exploring the `palmerpenguins` dataset. This package was created as a submission for the ETC5523 Assignment 4 at Monash University.

The dashboard allows users to visualize the relationships between different measurements of penguins, such as bill length, bill depth, and body mass, while filtering the data by species and other attributes.

## Installation

You can install the development version of `penguinDash` from GitHub with:

```{r}
install.packages("pak")
Make sure to replace the GitHub path with your own repository details
pak::pak("YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME/penguinDash")

text
```


```{r example}
library(penguinDash)
## basic example code
```

What is special about using `README.Rmd` instead of just `README.md`? You can include R chunks like so:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

You'll still need to render `README.Rmd` regularly, to keep `README.md` up-to-date. `devtools::build_readme()` is handy for this.

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo = FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

In that case, don't forget to commit and push the resulting figure files, so they display on GitHub and CRAN.
